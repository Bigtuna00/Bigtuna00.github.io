<P>So I crashed my motorcycle on December 27th, go me!

<P><B>Note to self:</B> jumping in heavy/gusty wind = broken body parts

<P>I fractured my radius and had surgery on January 5 to install a plate and pins that would reduce the fracture and hopefully restore a smooth joint surface.

<P>Here are a couple of pictures of the carnage:

<P><B>Another note to self:</B> one-handed typing sucks, avoiding the breaking of any arm/wrist/hand bones in future endeavors.
