<P>These are my thoughts on the <A HREF="http://www.goodridge.net" TARGET="_new">Goodridge</A> Stainless Steel Brake Lines:

<P><OL>
   <LI>I noticed one of the lines was defective on arrival.  I sent it back to Goodridge 
       and they replaced it within a week.  Good service.
   <LI>The "shoulders" on the lines, the part that attaches to the hard line and not the 
       caliper, do not mount correctly.  They are loose and can move around in the body 
       mounts.  Right now my lines are zip tied in place on the body mounts.
   <LI>My installer discovered that one of the rear lines is also defective.  The threads 
       in the shoulder are too tight, so you can't start screwing it in.  So, I have 3 
       stainless lines and one stock right now...
</OL>

<P>Needless to say, I am not pleased with these lines at all.  They DO feel really good, 
the brakes have firmed up and the pedal travel was reduced.  But the quality of the lines
seems to be suspect.

<P>Since last time I sent my defective lineback, plus one stock front line and one stock rear line.

<P>I got a completely new set of lines from Goodridge today.  Apparently they fabricated a
kit for me from the stock lines I sent them.  They look completely different than the kit
I got from <A HREF="http://www.phronline.com" TARGET="_new">PHR Online</A>:

            <P>Here's the old kit:

            <P><IMG SRC="jpgs/goodridge/goodridge.jpg" WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="288"> 
            <P>You can barely make out the old shoulder in the top of that picture.  It looks totally
 different.

<P>So if you have problems getting them installed, call Goodridge up.

<P>So, I went to get the new lines installed today. Turns out the clips they provided 
me to retain the lines are too thick (see the pic above). The stock clips worked fine
though (luckily they were still lying around the shop). I'll call Goodridge and let 
them know.

<P>BUT!!! Again, one of the lines was defective. This time they forgot to drill the
hole in the fitting that attaches to the caliper so no fluid could flow through!!!
We're sittin' there trying to bleed the brakes and the mechanic's like "WTF? There's
no fluid!"

<P>Needless to say I'm pretty PO'd at Goodridge. It sucks, they have some of the best
customer service I've ever encountered (I mean, they fabricated a kit for me) but
their product seems to suck.

<P>Buyer beware I guess.

<P>I spoke to the service manager at Goodridge last week to inquire about possibly
getting a reimbursment for install charges for the lines.  He asked me to FAX my
receipts, which I will do.

<P>In the meantime I also sent the most recent defective line back.

        <P>Well, my lines are finally done!!! I got the replacement for the most 
          recent defective line several weeks ago. I then had to hunt down the 
          brake fluid I wanted to use since no one around here sells it :( I ended 
          up using <A HREF="http://www.motul.com/uk/index.html" TARGET="_new">Motul</A> 
          DOT 5.1 brake fluid. I ordered it from <A HREF="http://www.inlinefour.com" TARGET="_new"> 
          www.inlinefour.com</A>. Let me tell you, this stuff is awesome!
        <P>The brakes feel so good now. Pedal travel is really minimal before 
          they grab and the feeling is really solid when they finally do. A this 
          point I am pretty happy with this kit, even though it was so much trouble 
          to get it on my car. Hopefully my work with Goodridge will benefit anyone 
          else who buys these brake lines. With the new design the kit should 
          bolt right on...

        <P>I'm a little afraid that this review will put people off from buying this kit from
Goodridge.  I honestly think what happened is that they were selling a pre-2000
Celica brake kit and assumed it would work in the 2000 cars.  Now that I basically
provided them some stock lines with which they could create a new kit, the kits
should hopefully be good to go.  Keep in mind that these lines are on the cheap side
too.  Other company's lines run $180-$200.  I guess you get what you pay for?

<P>Ok, I hope this helps someone.

<P>Thanks,
